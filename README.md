# My Spotify Mockup

Each and every day while I code, I listen to music on Spotify. Therefore, I'm navigating back and forth across different windows, one of them is **_Spotify._**

_This is just a simple reference idea of what I wanted to get_

Now you might see an ordinary spotify desktop version, but what I was looking at and thinking about all along was our beloved `grid`, so I went for **it.**

- Skills tested:  `grid`, `flexbox` and `positioning.`
- I managed to make approx. 4 breakpoints to achieve `responsivity.`
   - Breakpoints implemented: `<1400px, <1200px, <850px, & <650px (Mobile version).`

## The process:

##### Fun Fact

- I tried creating a design on Figma but that failed terribly...

.... So I continued by looking at spotify only...



### First column:
- Built with flex, grid, icons and a bunch of images.

- _I thought I was never gonna finish adding the content..._


### Second Column:
- Applied mostly grid and flex for supporting icons and alignment.

- For a better experience, I researched and learned to make custom `scroll bars!`

- Me when I couldn't resize the images properly:

### 3rd and Final Column:

- Based on `flexbox`, it was brought to life.

### The regret...

- Halfway through the project, I realized I still had a long way to go and `responsiveness` still to be done.

- In the end the timing was enough and I achieved it:

#### Lessons learned:

- Research more effectively about timelines for such big projects.
- Based on such a long code, look for ways to write more concise code in the future.
- Getting the Spotify official typography is complicated.

#### Glossary:

- `Flex`: It's a one-dimensional way of arranging items in rows or columns.
- `Grid`: It's a bi-dimensional styling property that allows you to arrange your site in columns and rows.
